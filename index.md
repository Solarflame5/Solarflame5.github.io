### Programming
I'm not very skilled at programming but I'm trying to improve, I use Python 3 for most of my projects.
### 3D Modelling
I have some experience in Blender and mostly do low-poly work, though I'm not very good at setting up scenes for renders.
### Games
I mostly enjoy playing Team Fortress 2, Old School RuneScape, Terraria, Tower Unite, Minecraft(Vanilla and modded), Euro Truck Simulator 2, Garry's Mod and Unturned.
